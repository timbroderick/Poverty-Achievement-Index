Daily Herald Poverty-Achievement Index files
===============

The Poverty-Achievement Index, published [here](http://www.dailyherald.com/lowincome/) by the Daily Herald in 2015, was an award-winning collaboration with WBEZ. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be online anymore, but you can see it here: [timbroderick.github.io/Poverty-Achievement-Index/](https://timbroderick.github.io/Poverty-Achievement-Index/)

The index was updated through 2017, until I left the Daily Herald for Modern Healthcare magazine in Fall of 2018. Even though the tests changed during that time period, and the state of Illinois updated it's school funding formula to bolster schools with higher percentages of low-income students, the same stratification shown by the index continued after all those changes.
